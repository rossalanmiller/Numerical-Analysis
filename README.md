# Numerical-Analysis
A series of Numerical Analysis Projects

Numerical analysis is used to find approximate solutions that are close enough for practical use.
Iterative methods are used to approximate these solutions. The more iterations used the closer the approximation.
This repository contains several of the projects I wrote from scratch for solving equations of varios kinds including
linear, non-lineark, and systems of linear and non-linear equations.
